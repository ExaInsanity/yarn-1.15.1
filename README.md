# Yarn 1.15.1

## Introduction

Yarn, the mappings used by the Fabric mod loader and its forks & derivatives, was originally not designed to handle Java 16. 

These problems are fixed with this new build script and several other, smaller changes made.

## Usage

Clone this repository and open the folder in any shell. Run ./gradlew yarn - or, if you have gradle installed, gradle yarn. 

An Enigma window will open.

Select File > Export Sources and export the source code, deobfuscated and decompiled.

This process will take a while.

## Requirements

Java 16
Gradle 7.x recommended
